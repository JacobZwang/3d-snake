## 3d Snake
[See Website](jacobzwang.com/3d-snake).
Inspiration
The game snake is a classic, it's simple, easy to understand and runs on just about anything. I noticed that next to no one have ever made the game in 3d. And I don't mean it looks 3d, I mean the snake moves in 3d dimensions.

What it does
It's snake just like how you know it.

Controls: W: forward A: left S: backward D: right E: up Q: down

FAQ
Q: "Won't it be too easy because there is so much room?" A: "Sure it's easy to stay alive, but good luck actually getting the fruit, it's really hard."

How I built it
It uses Three.js.

Challenges I ran into
I have never used three.js before, it was slightly confusing to pick up quickly.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of
It works! I can't belive it works! I ran in to many problems with three.js, and I solved them in the most jank way possible. Despite my noodle code, due to my first attempt at three.js, it works perfectly.

What I learned
I learned three.js

What's next for 3D Snake
Add ability to lose. Rewrite in Rust and Wasm for low level control.
